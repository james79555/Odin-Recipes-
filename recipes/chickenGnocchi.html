        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3/4 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Slice chicken breasts in half horizontally to create thin breasts. 
            Sprinkle with seasonings.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in the skillet and cook until golden brown on each side, about 4 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, melt butter. Add gnocchi and season with salt and pepper. Cook until gnocchi is golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove gnocchi to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add broccoli, zucchini, squash, mushrooms, and bell pepper and season with Italian seasoning. 
            Saute until vegetables are crisp and tender, 5 to 7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the vegetables. 
            Add minced garlic during the last 45 seconds; quickly saute until fragrant. Remove vegetables to the same bowl with gnocchi.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the same skillet; and cook shallot until softened and fragrant, about 3 minutes. 
            Pour in chicken broth, half-and-half, and heavy cream. Whisk in flour, and cook, whisking to prevent lumps, until thickened, about 3 minutes. 
            Squeeze in lemon juice to taste.</li>
        <li>Combine gnocchi and vegetables with cream sauce, and top with cooked chicken.</li>
    </ol>
