    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked jasmine rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 pound medium peeled, deveined raw shrimp</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil, plus small leaves for garnish</li>
        <li>lemon wedges for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Add onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. 
            Add garlic, and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is fragrant and onions are lightly browned, about 1 minute. 
            Stir in wine, and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken stock, lemon zest, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil over medium, and stir in rice. 
            Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer, undisturbed, until rice is just cooked through, 9 to 10 minutes. 
            Add shrimp to rice in an even layer; drizzle with lemon juice, and dot with remaining 4 tablespoons butter. 
            Cover and continue to cook over medium until shrimp and rice are cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in Parmesan cheese and basil. Garnish with lemon wedges and basil leaves.</li>
    </ol>
